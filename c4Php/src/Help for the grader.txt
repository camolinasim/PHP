What's inside of this code:
Info folder works well
New folder works well

Play folder has some issues I was never able to solve. But here's what I
took care of:

*ack_move class takes care of the user's moves logic (i.e. isWin, isDraw)
and is able to return a UserWinningPlay array containing the 4 winning moves
of the user)

Move is the AI's class. Only random strategy works, but it is able to do
isWin(), isDraw() well and can also return a AIWinningPlay array containing
the 4 winning moves of the AI.
